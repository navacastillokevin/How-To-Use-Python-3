    "## How I did that?\n",
    "First I put a standard translator output in order to the program can say de words \"Hi\" and \"How old are the three students? \" because I want that the computer can show up with the last words.\n",
    "\n",
    "I put some quotation marks beacuase is the replay that I want the computer do and I close the word with parenthesis because is the result that the computer is going to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then if i want that three differents students writte their ages a writte three differents coamnds of ages in order to the computer can ask for the age of three differents students, after this we need to writte a result sign because after this the computer is going to throw the result, then we need to write de comand int because it means that computer can receive a entire numbers because we are asking for the ages of the students, then we writte with a patenthesis the comand input and followed by this we writte another parenthesis beause in here we are gone to writte the three ages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then if you want to know the sample mean you need to write de comand sample meaning followed by this we writte a result sign writting the comand int with two open parenthesis, then you need to writte de coamd of the three ages  with the plus sign beacuse in order to get the sample mean we need to plus all the ages and divide between the quantity of all them, then you need to close the first operation and after we write de divided sign and the total of the ages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we write the comand print followed by a parrenthesis and f string because with this comand we can get any posibility that is valid, then we put some quotation marks because after this the computer is going to throw the words and then we writte some brackets because are ordered sequences of elements, in here we write the comand that we created the sample mean, here we get the result of the sample mean of the ages of the three students."
